This is a prototype for an application that will allow college students to view nearby events, as well as creating a profile from preferred "tags" to prioritize desired events.

The idea is that any student will be able to create an event and detail its time and location, and that event will become visible to fellow students. I understand that colleges may want students to know which events are from school-endorsed clubs and organizations, so the prototype includes a blue checkmark on events from official clubs.

Right now, it is not possible to edit the user profile, but if this project continues, adding or removing tags from the profile will adjust the timeline to prioritize events with tags that exist in the user's profile.

To view the prototype, download and open the html file named "frame".
